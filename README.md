# Java_Rest_API

Hello,

This project is a RESTful API built in Java using Maven and Spring Boot. The repository is divided into two branches:

main branch: This branch holds the license and the README file.
master branch: This branch holds the actual code for the API.


The project functionality consists of:
Products: This section manages product data, offering endpoints for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE operations.
Security: This section handles user-based authentication and authorization for secure access to endpoints.
Unit Tests: Unit tests ensure code quality and robustness, classes tested being ProductController and ProductService.
